\anitha{I dont know if we need it here or in the conclusion}
Contrary to the general notion that it is impossible or extraordinarily difficult to identify all trace link in practice~\cite{stravsunskas2002traceability}, some of the initial results from our recent efforts~\cite{IVCTechReport} indicate that such complete requirements satisfaction trace can be established, in fact automatically in the realm of formal methods and model based developments. In the next section, we breifely describe our prior work and our plans to extend it to establish complete traceability. While the details the approach and initial results are not in scope of this paper, an interested reader is directed to~\cite{IVCTechReport}.
