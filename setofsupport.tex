\section{Discussion}

While the notion of completeness in requirements traceability is not  a new topic, our argument is that it is not been rigorously defined and assessed.


Although, completeness in requirements traceability has always been desired, to the best of our knowledge, determining the completeness in establishing trace has  has not been discussed rigorously. There is almost always a human input involved in assessing the completeness and correctness of the trace links.


Completeness and correctness of trace links go hand-in-hand.



impossible or extraordinarily difficult to identify


To paritally address this concern for satisfaction arguments, \emph{Rich traceability} introduced the notion of AND and OR composition.However, this approach was based on traceable links in the artifacts, that had to be present/put in by humans that makes it time consuming, error prone.... \anitha{i dont know what to say}. We want to build a complete satisfaction argument that captures all the associations between the requirements and its components. This way it achieves far more purposes than just satisfaction.

Complete traceability

This information reveals the propagation of change that can result when a specific requirement is deleted or modified. If you’ve mapped specific requirements into tasks in your project’s work-breakdown structure, those tasks will be affected when a requirement is changed or deleted.

At one level, requirements tracing provides a way to demonstrate compliance with a contract or specification. At a more sophisticated level, requirements tracing can improve the quality of your products, reduce maintenance costs, and facilitate reuse. Following are some potential benefits of implementing requirements traceability.

\anitha{I dont know if we need it here or in the conclusion}
Contrary to the general notion that it is impossible or extraordinarily difficult to identify all trace link in practice~\cite{stravsunskas2002traceability}, some of the initial results from our recent efforts~\cite{IVCTechReport} indicate that such complete requirements satisfaction trace can be established, in fact automatically in the realm of formal methods and model based developments. In the next section, we breifely describe our prior work and our plans to extend it to establish complete traceability. While the details the approach and initial results are not in scope of this paper, an interested reader is directed to~\cite{IVCTechReport}.
